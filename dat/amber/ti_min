&cntrl
  imin=1,     ! minimization flag; 0 - Do not minimize; 1 - Do minimization
  ntx=1,      ! Option to read the initial coordinates
                ! 1 - read coordinates (no velocities) from ascii file
                ! 2 - read coordinates (no velocities) from binary file
                ! 4 - coordinates and velocities from binary file
                ! 5 - coordinates and velocities from ascii file. box if ntb>0
                !     velocities will be used if irest=1
                ! 6 - Coordinates, velocities, and box from binary
  maxcyc=500, ! maximum number of cycles of minimization, default = 1
  ntpr=100,   ! write energy information every ntpr steps, default = 50
  ntmin=1,    ! optimization algorithm 
                ! 0 - conjugate gradient
                ! 1 - NCYC cycles with steepest descent then conjugate gradient
                ! 2 - steepest descent
                ! 3 - XMIN
                ! 4 - LMOD
  ntf=1,      ! force evaluation. 
              !  1 - complete interaction is calculated (default)
              !  2 - bond interaction involving H-atoms omitted (for ntc=2)
              !  3 - all the bond interactions are omitted (with ntc=3)
              ! ...
  ntc=1,      ! flag for SHAKE (should be used in most MD calculations).
              ! 1 - SHAKE is not performed.
              ! 2 - bonds involving hydrogen are constrained
              ! 3 - all bonds are constrained
  ntb=1,      ! Flag for periodic boundaries (may no be set). value is 
              !  inferred from igb and ntb
                 ! 0 - no periodicity
                 ! 1 - constant volume
                 ! 2 - constant pressure
  cut=8.0,    ! Nonbonded cutoff (8 is a good value)
  icfe=1      ! flag for free energy calculations; 0 - off; 1 - on
  ifsc=       ! softcore potentials flag; 0 - sc off; 1 - sc on
  crgmask=    ! charge mask, set the partial charge of these atoms to zero
  scmask=     ! specifies the unique atoms for the sc potential
  clambda=    ! the value of lambda for the ti calculation
